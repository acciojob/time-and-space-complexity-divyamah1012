	<h1>Time,Space,and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is an important factor in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time required to process input, which becomes increasingly crucial as the scale of the problem grows. By analyzing time complexity, we can compare different algorithms to select the one that performs optimally, ensuring that resources are used wisely and operations are completed in a reasonable amount of time. In essence, an efficient time complexity allows systems to scale and operate more effectively.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input. It is crucial for evaluating how efficiently an algorithm uses memory, especially when handling large inputs or working with devices with limited resources.Space complexity is often expressed in Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the memory usage. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the amount of memory used grows linearly with the size of the input. In such cases, if the input size doubles, the memory required will also double, which highlights the importance of designing algorithms that are both time- and space-efficient to optimize performance across various systems.</p>
