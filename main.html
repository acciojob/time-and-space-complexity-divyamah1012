	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measurebecomes increasingly crucial as time complexity, s optimally, ensuring that resources are used wisely and operations are completed in a reasonable amount of time. In essence, an efficient time complexity allows systems to scale and operate more effectively.</p>
