	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is an important factor in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time required to process input, which becomes increasingly crucial as the scale of the problem grows. By analyzing time complexity, we can compare different algorithms to select the one that performs optimally, ensuring that resources are used wisely and operations are completed in a reasonable amount of time. In essence, an efficient time complexity allows systems to scale and operate more effectively.</p>
